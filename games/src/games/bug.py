"""
Position (int): an optional leading 1 (= player 1 to move; no leading digit = player 2 to move)
followed by 19 cell digits: 0 = empty, 1 = player 1 (W), 2 = player 2 (B).
Cell i (tile number i+1, reading order: left to right, top row first) is the i-th digit
from the RIGHT, so the last digit is tile 1 (row+column 11) and the first cell digit is tile 19 (53).

Move (int): the moving player's digit followed by two-digit tile numbers (01-19):
the placement first, then each growth in the order it happens.
e.g. 2140915 = player 2 places on tile 14, then grows onto tile 9, then onto tile 15.

Eating is resolved in a fixed order: after placing, the eater is always the player's bug
with the lowest-numbered cell (numbered on the board turned to its standard orientation,
see canonical(), so that rotated/mirrored boards play identically) that (a) touches an enemy bug of the same shape (rotations and
reflections allowed) and (b) still has a legal growth cell once those enemy bugs are removed.
It eats every such enemy bug next to it, then grows by one cell (each possible cell is a
separate move). This repeats until none of the player's bugs can eat.
